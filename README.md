# Paddle Project!

A simple ASP.NET project with a SQLite database "backend" – based on a few
easy measurements, figure out ideal dimensions for a starter paddle for
yourself. It'll also walk you through the first few steps of the
paddle-carving process, if that's your thing.

Far from finished, work in progress, the usual limitations apply. Feel
free to copy/reproduce with credit to Zeph Arvanitis and ideally a link
back to this project.
